# javascript-projects
These were the first series of projects I did while enrolled in the Springboard online bootcamp, pretty much all dealing with basic javascript.  
They were all done around September of 2020.
They should all be able to be run in the browser with no additional requirements.
As with most Springboard projects, they were completed as assignments and generally only meet the specified requirements, thus they may be unpolished and not handle all potential errors.
